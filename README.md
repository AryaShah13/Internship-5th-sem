Internship Experience â€“ Mamo Technolab, Vadodara (5th Semester)
During my 5th semester, I completed an internship at Mamo Technolab, Vadodara, where I worked primarily as a Frontend Developer and gained some hands-on experience in Backend Development as well.
I used HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, and Node.js to build two responsive websites that worked smoothly across both desktop and mobile devices.

Plastic Product Seller Website:

Developed a user-friendly interface showcasing plastic products.

Integrated video content to enhance product understanding.

Designed with a responsive layout for cross-device compatibility.

E-Commerce Website for Diwali Scheme:

Created a basic e-commerce platform tailored for Diwali promotional sales.

Implemented product listing, offers, and user interaction features.

Focused on frontend responsiveness and basic backend data handling.

These projects helped me strengthen my web development skills and understand how to create flexible, real-world applications.
